# forecasting_app
In this project, I want to create an app to display my forecasts

the app will have a main page, which shows all my forecasts and how they have developed over time. 
you will also be able to sleect individual forecasts to get to a detail page
  on the detail page more detailed information about the forecast will be shown, such as:
    updates to the forecast and when they were made as well as the reasons for updating
    resolution criteria and potential resolution date.
    For resolved forecasts, you will also be able to show the Brier score and Log scores in both base 2 and natural base. 
finally, you will be able to create new forecasts in the app.
